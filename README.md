# 2D Game Assignment: Maze Escape!
### Choose Your Own Adventure Game

## Concept
For our first Unity assignment, we were tasked with making a choose your own adventure game. 
Instead of making a fighting game like Monkey Island, I decided to make a story-type game. 
The story is quite simple, I didn't want to overcomplicate it and make too many endings so I could avoid confusion while making the game. 
There are two main story paths, and two endings. This is the prototype I wrote down:

I made a few revisions for the final version, but the story is more or less the same. I tried my best to keep it simple and short so that I could focus on making the game itself rather than the plot, my main goal here was to create a working choose your own adventure game. 

## Process
I ended up utilizing the adventure game template from the Github, and made changes with styling, storyline, etc. 
The original template had a scrollbar, which I didn't need, so I deleted it. It also did not erase the previous story choices so I erased that from the ```gameplayManager``` script.
I downloaded some Assets from the Unity asset store, such as ```UI elements``` and background music. 
I added a background image but decided not to add sprites, as I didn't know where to fit them in the project.
Here is the Starting screen:

My story choices were distributed into nodes, with the final node taking the player to the end screen, which has two buttons:



## Challenges
The biggest challenge for me was getting used to Unity and its capabilities and tools. It was very confusing at first, but I am getting the hang of it :')
Coding was also pretty challenging, as I have never used C# before and kept referring to the documentation. 

## Next Steps
I think the next step here would be making the game more interesting, maybe adding more endings and options or making a minigame within the story. I would have liked for the image to change with every choice, and have some of the buttons be actual images, but I did not know how to do either of these things.  


## Conclusion
This project was definitely a learning process. I'm glad it worked out and I hope to learn more about Unity while working on the final!
